# Morning Stretches

I really don't know when or how this name came from, but the main goal is to push you to create a new design everyday .

### Any goal of making such thing ?

Yes, it seems and it's an easy task, no WOW-like progress, but eventually you will notice that it became easier and easier to make stuff and feel comfortable with weird challenges.

For me the first study took me 6 full hours, believe it or not, the second study took me 11 hours !!!!
the third one took me 3 hours :)
